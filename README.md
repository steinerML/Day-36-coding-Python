# Day-36-coding-Python

This is the same program as the one made on Day 35th, but the difference is that it has been optimised so 
it executes faster just by adding an else: break statement.

The overall performance has been improved by a staggering 98%, meaning it went from executing in 0.28 seconds 
down to doing it in roughly 0.006 seconds, that's a 98% decrease
